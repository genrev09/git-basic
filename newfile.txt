Difference between Add, Commit and Push?
1. Add - Stages the changes/revisions made to the file in the queue or in stage.
2. Commit - Saves the changes with a revision log. Does not mean that it is already merged with the remote repository. Changes are still in local repository.
3. Push - Merges the change made to the remote repository
